# LangcabAPI_1.0

This is a Spring Boot based REST API for an App that can capture your vocabulary and uses a spaced repetition algorythm to help you train it.

## Background

When learning a language it's not always easy to remember all the vocabulary. Langcab will help you remember your words by using a spaced repetition algorithm. So Langcab will automatically detect how fast you learn and let's you recall every word often enough so you don't forget it, but just as often as necessary to remember.
Even the process of adding words into the system will steady your vocabulary. You can add as many languages as you want.
To use it just sign in via Google and start by adding your first word!
